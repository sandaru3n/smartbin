**Step 15:** Server sanitizes input, queries DB, formats report, and sends to UI
- Validates all input parameters
- Queries database for relevant data
- Formats data with statistics and aggregations
- Returns JSON response with chart data

**Step 16:** UI displays report (charts/tables) to authority
- Renders three interactive Chart.js visualizations
- Displays summary statistics cards
- Shows detailed data table
- Provides export options (PDF, CSV, Print)

### Collector Management Workflow:

**Step 17:** Authority navigates to 'Manage Collectors', selects collector and region, clicks 'Assign'

- Chooses region assignment
- Submits assignment

**Step 18:** Server updates DB and sends notification to collector
- Updates collector's region field in database
- Sends region assignment notification

## üìù Notes

- The route optimization uses Nearest Neighbor algorithm which provides good results in O(n¬≤) time
- For production with very large datasets, consider implementing more sophisticated algorithms like 2-opt or Christofides
- Notification system currently logs to console; integrate with actual notification services (FCM, SMS, Email) for production
- Export features (PDF/CSV) show alerts; implement using libraries like jsPDF and Papa Parse for production
