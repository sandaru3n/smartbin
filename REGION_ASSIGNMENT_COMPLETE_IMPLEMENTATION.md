# Region Assignment Feature - Complete Implementation

## ‚úÖ Step 16: Allocate Collector to Region - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### Feature Overview
The **Region Assignment** feature allows authorities to assign waste collectors to specific geographical regions. The implementation includes database persistence, audit trails, and real-time notifications.

---

## üéØ Requirements Implementation

### 16a. Authority navigates to 'Manage Collectors' ‚úÖ
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8086/authority/manage-collectors`
- **Access**: Authority users only (role-based authentication)
- **UI**: Modern, responsive Google Material Design interface

### 16b. UI displays collector and region lists ‚úÖ
- **Collectors Display**:
  - All collectors shown in table format
  - Shows: Name, Email, Phone, Current Region, Status
  - Real-time data from database
  - Filter by status/region
  - Search functionality

- **Region Options**:
  - North District
  - South District
  - East District
  - West District
  - Central District

### 16c. Authority selects collector & region, clicks 'Assign' ‚úÖ
- **Single Assignment**: Click "üìç Assign" button next to collector
- **Bulk Assignment**: Select multiple collectors and assign to same region
- **UI Features**:
  - Shows current region (if assigned)
  - Dropdown with all available regions
  - Confirmation before assignment
  - Loading indicator during process

### 16d. Server updates DB and notifies collector via Collector App ‚úÖ
**Database Updates** (2 tables):

1. **Users Table** - Current assignment:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET region = 'North District', updated_at = NOW() 
   WHERE id = <collector_id>
   ```

2. **region_assignments Table** - Complete history:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO region_assignments 
   (collector_id, assigned_by_id, previous_region, new_region, assigned_at, status, notes)
   VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW(), 'ACTIVE', 'Assigned via Manage Collectors interface')
   ```

**Notification System**:
- Sends notification to collector via `NotificationService`
- Notification includes region details
- Collector receives update in Collector App

### 16e. UI shows "Assignment Successful" message to authority ‚úÖ
- **Success Toast Notification**:
  ```
  ‚úÖ Assignment Successful!
  
  Collector: John Doe
  Region: North District
  
  The collector has been notified via the Collector App.
  ```
- **Auto-refresh**: Page reloads to show updated assignments
- **Response includes**:
  - Previous region
  - New region
  - Assignment ID
  - Assigned by (authority name)
  - Timestamp

## üìä Database Schema

### New Table: `region_assignments`
```sql
CREATE TABLE region_assignments (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    collector_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    assigned_by_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    previous_region VARCHAR(255),
    new_region VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    assigned_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- ACTIVE, SUPERSEDED, CANCELLED
    notes VARCHAR(500),
    FOREIGN KEY (collector_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (assigned_by_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**Purpose**: Tracks complete history of all region assignments for audit and analytics

### Updated Table: `users`
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN region VARCHAR(255);
```

**Purpose**: Stores current active region for quick access

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. **RegionAssignment Entity**
**File**: `src/main/java/com/sliit/smartbin/smartbin/model/RegionAssignment.java`

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "region_assignments")
public class RegionAssignment {
    private Long id;
    private User collector;
    private User assignedBy;
    private String previousRegion;
    private String newRegion;
    private LocalDateTime assignedAt;
    private String notes;
    private AssignmentStatus status;
    
    public enum AssignmentStatus {
        ACTIVE, SUPERSEDED, CANCELLED
    }
}
```

#### 2. **RegionAssignmentRepository**
**File**: `src/main/java/com/sliit/smartbin/smartbin/repository/RegionAssignmentRepository.java`

```java
@Repository
public interface RegionAssignmentRepository extends JpaRepository<RegionAssignment, Long> {
    List<RegionAssignment> findByCollectorOrderByAssignedAtDesc(User collector);
    List<RegionAssignment> findByAssignedByOrderByAssignedAtDesc(User assignedBy);
    List<RegionAssignment> findByNewRegionOrderByAssignedAtDesc(String region);
    List<RegionAssignment> findByCollectorAndStatus(User collector, AssignmentStatus status);
}
```

#### 3. **Assignment API Endpoint**
**File**: `AuthorityController.java`
**Endpoint**: `POST /authority/api/assign-collector`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "collectorId": 1,
  "region": "North District"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Collector John Doe assigned to North District successfully!",
  "previousRegion": "South District",
  "newRegion": "North District",
  "assignmentId": 42,
  "assignedBy": "Admin Authority",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T14:30:00"
}
```

**Process Flow**:
1. Validates authority user session
2. Fetches collector from database
3. Marks previous assignments as SUPERSEDED
4. Creates new assignment record
5. Updates user's region field
6. Sends notification to collector
7. Returns success response with details

#### 4. **Assignment History API**
**Endpoint**: `GET /authority/api/region-assignments?collectorId=<id>`

**Response**:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 42,
    "collectorId": 1,
    "collectorName": "John Doe",
    "assignedById": 5,
    "assignedByName": "Admin Authority",
    "previousRegion": "South District",
    "newRegion": "North District",
    "assignedAt": "2025-10-16T14:30:00",
    "status": "ACTIVE",
    "notes": "Assigned via Manage Collectors interface"
  }
]
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### Assignment Modal
**File**: `manage-collectors.html`

```javascript
function openAssignModal(collectorId, collectorName, currentRegion) {
    // Show current region
    // Load region dropdown
    // Handle form submission
}
```

**Features**:
- Shows collector name (read-only)
- Displays current region with warning badge
- Region dropdown with all options
- Assignment details info box
- Loading state during submission
- Error handling

## üìù Database Verification

### Check Current Assignments
```sql
SELECT 
    u.id,
    u.name,
    u.email,
    u.region,
    u.updated_at
FROM users u
WHERE u.role = 'COLLECTOR'
ORDER BY u.name;
```

### Check Assignment History
```sql
SELECT 
    ra.id,
    c.name AS collector_name,
    ra.previous_region,
    ra.new_region,
    ra.assigned_at,
    ra.status,
    a.name AS assigned_by
FROM region_assignments ra
JOIN users c ON ra.collector_id = c.id
JOIN users a ON ra.assigned_by_id = a.id
ORDER BY ra.assigned_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Active Assignments Only
```sql
SELECT 
    c.name AS collector,
    ra.new_region AS current_region,
    ra.assigned_at,
    a.name AS assigned_by
FROM region_assignments ra
JOIN users c ON ra.collector_id = c.id
JOIN users a ON ra.assigned_by_id = a.id
WHERE ra.status = 'ACTIVE'
ORDER BY ra.assigned_at DESC;
```

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication
- Only authenticated AUTHORITY users can access
- Session validation on every request
- Role-based access control

### Authorization
- Validates user role before allowing assignments
- Prevents unauthorized access to assignment endpoints
- Logs all assignment activities with user ID

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphan records
- Transaction management ensures atomic operations
- Status tracking prevents conflicting assignments

---

## üìä Audit Trail

Every assignment is fully tracked:
- ‚úÖ **Who**: Authority user who made assignment
- ‚úÖ **What**: Collector and regions (previous ‚Üí new)
- ‚úÖ **When**: Timestamp of assignment
- ‚úÖ **Why**: Notes field for additional context
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Active, Superseded, or Cancelled

### Sample Audit Query
```sql
SELECT 
    DATE(ra.assigned_at) AS date,
    COUNT(*) AS total_assignments,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ra.collector_id) AS unique_collectors,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ra.assigned_by_id) AS unique_authorities
FROM region_assignments ra
WHERE ra.assigned_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY DATE(ra.assigned_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

---

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_collector_status ON region_assignments(collector_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_assigned_at ON region_assignments(assigned_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_new_region ON region_assignments(new_region);
```

### Caching Strategy
- User data cached in session
- Region list loaded once from static config
- Assignment history paginated for large datasets

### Query Optimization
- Uses JPA fetch strategies (LAZY loading)
- Efficient queries with proper indexes
- Batch updates for bulk assignments

---

## üìà Analytics & Reporting

### Available Metrics
- Total assignments per day/week/month
- Most active regions
- Assignment patterns by authority
- Collector region tenure (how long in each region)
- Region coverage statistics

### Sample Analytics Query
```sql
SELECT 
    new_region,
    COUNT(*) AS assignment_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT collector_id) AS unique_collectors,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(NOW(), assigned_at)) AS avg_days_in_region
FROM region_assignments
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY new_region
ORDER BY assignment_count DESC;
```

---

## üéì Best Practices Implemented

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate entities for current state (User.region) and history (RegionAssignment)
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all assignments
3. **Status Tracking**: ACTIVE/SUPERSEDED/CANCELLED prevents conflicts
4. **Atomic Operations**: Transactions ensure data consistency
5. **Notification System**: Collectors notified immediately
6. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages
7. **Validation**: Input validation on both frontend and backend
8. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
9. **Security**: Role-based access and session validation
10. **Performance**: Optimized queries and proper indexing
