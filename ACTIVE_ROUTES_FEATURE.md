## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **HTML Structure:**

```html
<div class="active-routes-section">
    <h2 class="section-title active">
        <span class="material-icons">local_shipping</span>
        Active Routes
        <span class="active-count">[count]</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="section-description">Routes ready to start or currently in progress</p>
    
    <!-- Active Route Cards -->
    <div class="routes-grid active-grid">
        <div class="route-card active-route">
            <!-- Route details -->
            <!-- Assigned bins -->
            <!-- Action buttons -->
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Empty State -->
    <div class="no-routes" th:if="${assignedCount + inProgressCount == 0}">
        <span class="material-icons">info</span>
        <p>No active routes at the moment. Check back later for new assignments!</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### **Thymeleaf Filtering:**

```html
th:if="${route.status.name() == 'ASSIGNED' or route.status.name() == 'IN_PROGRESS'}"
```

This ensures only active routes appear in the Active Routes section.

### **Active Count Calculation:**

```html
<span class="active-count" th:text="${assignedCount + inProgressCount}">3</span>
```

Dynamically calculates and displays the total number of active routes.
