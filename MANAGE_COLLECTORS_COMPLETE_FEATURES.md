### Database Schema
Uses existing User table with fields:
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Collector name
- `email`: Contact email
- `phone`: Contact phone
- `region`: Assigned region (nullable)
- `role`: COLLECTOR enum value
- `address`: Physical address
- `created_at`, `updated_at`: Timestamps

Related tables:
- `routes`: Route assignments
- `collections`: Collection records
- `route_bins`: Bins in routes

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Page Load**:
   - Server renders page with collector list from database
   - JavaScript initializes after DOM ready
   - Fetches real-time data from `/api/collectors`
   - Updates table cells with route and performance data
   - Calculates and displays statistics

2. **Filter/Search**:
   - User enters search term or selects filter
   - JavaScript filters visible rows in real-time
   - No server call needed (client-side filtering)
   - Updates empty state if no results

3. **Assignment**:
   - User selects collector and region
   - POST request to `/api/assign-collector`
   - Backend updates database
   - Notification sent to collector
   - Page refreshes to show updated data

4. **Details View**:
   - User clicks View button
   - Data fetched from API (already loaded)
   - Modal populated with collector information
   - Quick actions enabled

5. **Export**:
   - User clicks Export button
   - Fetches latest data from API
   - Generates CSV in browser
   - Triggers download

## üîê Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated authority users can access
- **Session Validation**: Each request validates user session
- **Role-Based Access**: AUTHORITY role required
- **Input Validation**: All inputs validated on backend
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using JPA parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Thymeleaf auto-escapes output
